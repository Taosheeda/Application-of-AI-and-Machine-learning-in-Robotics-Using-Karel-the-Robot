# Application-of-AI-and-Machine-learning-in-Robotics-Using-Karel-the-Robot
The World today is revolving around sophisticated technology in which robots are used to perform various tasks with a human-like vision to recognize various objects using great precision and accuracy.

Robots are now created using machine learning training. Also, a sizable number of datasets are utilized to train the computer vision model, enabling robotics to distinguish distinct objects and take the appropriate actions.

Insied the source-code attached, I wrote some set of codes in python which was used to direct Karel the robot to perform two different tasks within its world.

### Steeple-Chase (Task 1)
This task is a kind of simulation that shows Karel as an athlete in a relay race that involves running and jumping some hurdles before crossing the finish line.

### Mountain Karel (Task 2)
In this Task, I will be teaching Karel the robot to hike a mountain and command Karel to place a beeper at the peak of the mountain before descending. It sounds cool, right? Let get started

## Introduction.

Karel is a programming language that is used for teaching beginners the basics of programming and robotics. It is a high-level programming language that is easy to learn and understand.

Karel is also used to teach a wide range of concepts including control flow, functions, and basic algorithms. It is also used to explain an introduction to robotics, as the students can learn about basic concepts such as sensors, actuators, and feedback control.

## Requirements

PyCharm - for running and testing our codes. You don't have it? Don't worry you can download it for free here [Pycharm by JetBrains]

You can also write and run your code using [Coding rooms workspace]. It's free

You can as well use VS code, you will need to download python extension though

Basic Knowledge of Python.
